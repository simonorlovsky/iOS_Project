# iOS_Project
This is a project for CS342. Some goals quoted from the assignment:

1. Upon launch, your app should present the user with a UITableView, as in the ListDemo sample from my swift_samples repository. Each of the list items should have a disclosure arrow on the right side to indicate that a tap on that item will cause navigation to a new screen.

2. The main screen should have a navigation bar with a title and a bottom toolbar containing at least an About item that takes the user to an About screen.
When the user taps on a list item, the app should navigate to a new UIViewController whose content is described in the list item itself. (For example, if the list item says "Cow", the new screen might show an image of a cow, which moos when you tap on it.)

3. Each screen visited in this way should have a standard back arrow in the upper left corner of the navigation bar. Tapping on the back arrow, of course, should return the user to the original list screen.

4. Your list should have at least three items, and the associated UIViewController screens should explore different iOS tools or techniques. Your separate screens could, for example, include a tappable image view screen (like the cow described above), a web view (i.e. a mini web browser in your app), a bunch of standard controls like checkboxes and radio buttons and text fields, a map view, a scroll view, an experiment with sound, a video, etc. etc. Keep each screen focused on one basic iOS tool or technique.

5. In general, your screens should slide in from the right and slide back out to the right when the user taps the back arrow. On the other hand, if you want to experiment with other animations, that's a good use of some list items.

6. Make sure you include enough text labels to help a user understand what tools and techniques each screen is exploring. That is, other members of this class should be able to figure out what's going on in your app just by playing with it.
